ðŸš€ VALIDATION UPDATE ðŸš€

I have verified snapshots from the following 5 BPs + 1 Independant to match:
1. EOS Authority
2. EOS Rio
3. eosDAC 
4. EOSphere
5. EOS New York
6. Max Infeld

The snapshot from EOS Store had 2 discrepancies (they were only team using another tool than genesis, they used https://github.com/EOSBIXIN/eostoolkit). The discrepancies were in the accounts:
1. 0x94a717c2a6f8e1b2b217fe9b49d04b8de0e430ce
2. 0x69d645ad13ca271ddee97da896dae0822516ecfe

EOS Asia is currently running a snapshot, message me with any other snapshots you find.

The updated repo with all snapshots is here: https://github.com/eoscafe/eos-snapshot-validation
